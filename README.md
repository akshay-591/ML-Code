# ML-Code
This Repo Contains Codes for Machine Learning Models in Python, Java and C++.
There are no External Libraries Like TensorFlow and PyTorch is used, Only numpy, ND4J and Eigen for Matrix operation and SciPy for minimization function like CG is used.
All the Data in these models are taken from ML course on Coursera by prof. Andrew ng.
