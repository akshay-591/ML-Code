This Repo Contains Codes for Machine Learning Models in Python and Java both.
There are no External Libraries Like TensorFlow and PyTorch is used, Only numpy and ND4J for Matrix operation and SciPy for minimization function like CG is used.
All the Data in these models are taken from ML course on Coursera by prof. Andrew ng.
